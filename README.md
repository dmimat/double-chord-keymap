A keymap for all IntelliJ-based IDEs where most shortcuts have two keystrokes:
the first one defines a group and the second one defines an action in this group
(e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+D, A for Debug > Attach to Process or
Ctrl/Cmd+N, U for Navigate > Find Usages).

You may want to try this keymap out if some of the following features are important to you:

Easy-to-remember mnemonic mappings
Same shortcuts across different operating systems
Fewer modifier keys
No conflicts with system shortcuts
No conflicts on non-English Latin keyboards
